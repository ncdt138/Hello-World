# Hello-World
Hello, thanks to you, I am writing a smart contract.
I am writing an opinion for the first time in a contract. The cancellation of my contract in a pool brought me this far. But I am very pleased and grateful to be among you and to know you. I send my love and respect to all of you. Many thanks, good work.I created a new repository, merged it with branches and named it and committed. I commit to open a pull request and merge the pull request.
